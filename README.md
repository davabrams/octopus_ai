Octopus AI contains:
- A model for an octopus, consisting of a head, limbs, and suckers.  Also, backround surface image generator, and attractor/repeller agent generator.
- A simulator for simulating octopus motion using various methods.
- ML training and inference pipelines for sucker color change, ie camouflage.
- Tensorboard outputs for model training.
- An ML inference server so that various ML models can be run on a separate server or distributed cluster, instead of locally.
- Visualization tools for all this stuff.

# why are you doing this
I don't know, but I can't stop.

# what to do

## Testing ðŸ§ª
Run the comprehensive test suite with a single command:
```bash
# Easiest method - using the test runner
python run_tests.py

# Alternative methods
make test      # If you have make
./test.sh      # Shell script

# With options
python run_tests.py --verbose    # Detailed output
python run_tests.py --coverage   # Coverage report
```

See `tests/README.md` for detailed testing documentation.
